## 💡 Why DXTranslate?

The official [DeepL website](https://deepl.com) can feel a bit bloated and slow at times. I wanted something lightweight and snappy. That’s why I created DXTranslate! It’s a minimalistic version that gets the job done without fuss. Plus, you don’t need an API key or token—just input your text and go! 🚀✨

## ✨ Features

- **Privacy First**: No ads, cookies or tracking. 🍪
- **Token-Free**: No need for API keys; just start translating! 🔑❌
- **Self-Host**: Want to run it on your own server? Go for it! 💻🚀
- **Lightweight**: Fast response times without all the bloat. ⚡
